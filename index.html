    <p>My name is Steve McNamara and I am originally from Illinois. Born and raised in a small town down state, then made my way to Chicago for professional school and thereafter. I moved to Lafayette, Colorado just a few weeks ago after my partner got a new job in Boulder. Previously I was an optometrist, but found coding to be very enjoyable. I hope to help streamline electronic health records in the future. In my free time I enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking, fishing, and camping.</p>
